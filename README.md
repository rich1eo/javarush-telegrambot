# Javarush Telegram Bot
![Бот](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72224397/130233913-4d952aad-1ad9-445f-892d-c15b9bd0750c.jpg)

JavaRush Telegram bot from community for community. Written by developers, who learned in [Javarush](https://javarush.ru).
## Idea
The main idea is to show how to create real application, which can be used by someone else. 
There are [set of posts](https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/2935-java-proekt-ot-a-do-ja-pishem-realjhnihy-proekt-dlja-portfolio), which are describing step by step guidelines of how it was created.
## MVP Scope
As a user, I want to subscribe on group of posts and get notification via telegram-bot every time, 
when new post, related to group subscriptions, has come.

# How it works 
Based on MVP Scope, we can specify next behaviours (here and after Telegram User, which is using JavaRush Telgegram bot will call User):
- User can subscribe on group of posts
- User can view list of group subscriptions on which user subscribes
- User can unsubscribe from group of posts
- User can set an inactive bot and do not receive notifications
- User can restart getting notifications
## Find new posts workflow
The workflow of finding new posts and send them to subscribers can be viewed here:

## Deployment
Deployment process as easy as possible:
Required software:
- terminal for running bash scripts
- docker
- docker-compose

to deploy application, switch to needed branch and run bash script:

$ bash start.sh ${bot_username} ${bot_token}

That's all.

# Local development
For local development and testing, use `docker-compose-test.yml`. 
Run command: 
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up
```
Next step, is to run SpringBoot app with configured **Edit Configuration** in which two env vars are provided: 

`bot.token=${BOT_TOKEN};bot.username=${BOT_USERNAME}`

And add VM Options: 

`-Dspring.profiles.active=test `

 With these configurations - run SpringBoot main method.

# Technological stack
- SpringBoot as a skeleton framework
- Spring Scheduler as a task manager
- MySQL database as a database for saving user and subscription info
- Flyway database migration tool
- Telegram-bot SpringBoot starter
- Spring Data starter
- Unirest - lib for working with REST calls
